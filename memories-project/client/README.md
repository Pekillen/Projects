# Client side

In this repository, you can find client-side code for the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), MERN-memories project.

The front-end was mainly built using React.js and Material-UI. However, there are a few other libraries used in the project (eg. Redux, Axios).

Feel free to go through the code and leave me a review!

Would love to hear feedback!


# Server side

The server-side was built mainly using Node.js, Express, however, here as well other libraries were in use as well. MongoDB was used for Database management and the App was built and deployed using Heroku.

The Projects allowed me to dig into the back-end structure, get acquainted, and allowed me to understand how one should interact with it.

Here also feel free to review the code!

I am always eager to learn and expand my horizons!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
